    const prompt = `Student profile: ${stream} aspirant, ${percent}% in Class 12, ${cat} category${state ? `, prefers ${state}` : ""}. Recommended exams: ${(exams || []).join(", ")}.

Apply standard Indian reservation relaxations (5% for OBC/EWS, 10% for SC/ST). Tailor every recommendation to the ${cat} category - mention reserved-seat opportunities, category-specific cut-offs, and scholarships where relevant.

TASK A - Write a detailed 4-6 sentence "summary" that:
  (1) States clearly whether ${percent}% under ${cat} clears the typical 2026 cut-off for ${stream},
  (2) Names the SPECIFIC entrance exams the student must crack and the realistic score/rank band needed in each (e.g. "JEE Main 85+ percentile gets you NITs in spot rounds for SC"),
  (3) Mentions 2-3 specific real colleges by name that this student can realistically target with this profile,
  (4) Flags any risk (e.g. domicile quota, board moderation, counselling rounds).
  Tone: confident, factual, written like a counsellor briefing - NOT generic.

TASK B - "advice": 1-2 sentences with a concrete next step (which exam to focus on, cut-off to clear, application deadline to watch).

TASK C - "webColleges": List 12 real, well-known, currently-operating Indian colleges (NIRF-ranked or UGC/AICTE approved) where this student is genuinely eligible at ${percent}% under ${cat}${state ? ` (prioritise ${state} when sensible)` : ""}. Order strictly best-to-worst by suitability. For each:
  - "name" (full official name),
  - "location" (City, State),
  - "exam" (the SPECIFIC entrance exam that gets them in, e.g. "JEE Main", "MHT-CET", "CUET-UG", "Direct admission on 12th marks"),
  - "reason" (1 line counsellor advice - why THIS college fits THIS student),
  - "pros" (exactly 3 short phrases, 2-4 words each).

TASK D - Partner picks: From this partner list (DekhoCampus), group up to 8 into "high" / "medium" / "reach" buckets. If list is empty, return empty buckets.

Partner candidate colleges (JSON, may be empty):
${JSON.stringify(shortList)}

Return ONLY valid JSON in this exact shape:

  "summary": "4-6 sentence detailed counsellor verdict",
  "advice": "1-2 sentence next step",
  "webColleges": [
    { "name": "Full college name", "location": "City, State", "exam": "Entrance exam name", "reason": "1-line why this fits", "pros": ["2-4 words", "2-4 words", "2-4 words"] }

  "buckets": {
    "high":   [{ "slug": "...", "reason": "1-line why" }],
